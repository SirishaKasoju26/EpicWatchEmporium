            <p>Welcome to Watch Shop</p>

            <p>A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person. It is designed to keep a
                consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed to
                be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands,
                leather straps, or any other kind of bracelet. A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a
                pocket, often attached to a chain.</p>

            <p>In our shop, we have sold many branded watches to many customers and they are unique.</p>

                    <p>When your package has shipped you will receive an automated email containing a tracking number.
                        Can't find the tracking email? Create an account on Watches.com using the email linked to your
                        order. Visit the "My Accounts" page and click on the order number that you wish to track. Orders
                        that have shipped will have an order status of "Completed" and the tracking number will be

                        order being placed. Please call us at (385) 219-4767 between 8am-5pm Pacific Standard Time for
                        immediate assistance. Emails will not guarantee order cancellations, as they are answered in the
                        order they are received. Orders cannot be cancelled after this 15 minute window. Preorders and
                        special orders cannot be cancelled as the funds have already been sent to the manufacturer to
                        secure your watch.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>What you are seeing are temporary authorizations from your bank for the declined attempt and your
                        financial institution should correct these within a few days as we have not and can’t process
                        them. Please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized to verify funds are available. A
                        pre-authorization is a temporary hold to verify that funds are available when you place an
                        order. If your transaction is unsuccessful your credit card may be authorized, but that does not
                        mean that it has been charged. It is not necessary to contact customer service to remove a
                        pre-authorization, if you need assistance removing a pre-authorization from your credit card
                        transaction history, please contact your bank or financial institution.</p>
